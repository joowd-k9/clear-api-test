# Processor Cost Tracking System - Executive Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive cost tracking system providing detailed visibility into processing costs for accurate billing, cost optimization, and financial reporting.

## Key Cost Components

### 1. Processor Base Costs
- **Charged once per execution per processor type**
- Configurable via database or configuration files
- **Example**: Clear Processor runs 3 times in one execution = $0.10 base cost (charged once)

### 2. External API Costs
- **Charged per API call**
- CLEAR: $0.75, Experian: $0.50, Equifax: $0.50
- **Cost Optimization**: Cached results = $0.00 cost

### 3. Processing Costs
- **Variable costs based on business rules**
- **Example**: OCR processing = $0.50 per page (5 pages = $2.50)

## Cost Tracking Hierarchy
```
Underwriting → Executions → Processor Runs
- One underwriting can have multiple executions
- One execution can have multiple processor runs
- Base costs charged once per execution per processor type
```

## Processing Execution Flows

### Single Processor Run Execution Flow
```
1. Processor Run Initialization
   ├── Check if base cost already charged for this processor type in execution
   ├── Initialize cost tracker for this run
   └── Set up run context within execution

2. Input Prevalidation
   └── Pre-validate account/underwriting IDs

3. Processing Pipeline
   ├── Validation Step → Processing Step → Extraction Step
   └── Track costs for each operation

4. Result Aggregation
   ├── Combine extracted factors from all inputs
   └── Prepare final output structure

5. Cost Calculation
   ├── Sum all tracked costs for this run
   ├── Add base cost only if first run of this processor type in execution
   └── Generate cost breakdown for this run

6. Result Return
   ├── Return ProcessingResult with cost breakdown
   └── Update execution history with run results
```

### External API Call Flow with Exception Handling
```
1. Execution Start → Begin processing

2. Run 1: API Call Preparation
   ├── Check cache for existing result
   └── If cached: return result with $0.00 cost

3. Run 1: First API Attempt
   ├── Track cost: $0.50 (Processor Base Cost)
   ├── Make HTTP request to external API
   └── If success: cache result and return

4. Run 1: Exception Occurs (if first attempt fails)
   ├── Track cost: $0.50 (attempted call)
   ├── Run 1 ends with failure
   └── Return ProcessingResult with failure status

5. Run 2: Retry (New Run within Same Execution)
   ├── Track cost: $0.50 (retry attempt)
   ├── Make HTTP request again
   └── If success: cache result and return

6. Run 3: Final Retry (New Run within Same Execution)
   ├── Track cost: $0.50 (final attempt)
   ├── Make HTTP request again
   └── If success: cache result and return

7. Execution Cost Summary
   ├── Total runs: 3
   ├── Total cost: $1.50
   └── Execution status: Failed
```

### Multi Processor Execution Flow
```
1. Execution Start → Begin processing

2. Run 1: Clear Processor
   ├── Base cost: $0.10 (charged once per processor type per execution)
   ├── Track cost: $0.75 (business search)
   └── Run cost: $0.75

3. Run 2: Experian Processor
   ├── Base cost: $0.10 (charged once per processor type per execution)
   ├── Track cost: $0.50 (business credit report)
   └── Run cost: $0.50

4. Run 3: Equifax Processor
   ├── Base cost: $0.10 (charged once per processor type per execution)
   ├── Track cost: $0.00 (cached result)
   └── Run cost: $0.00

5. Run 4: Bank Statement Processor
   ├── Base cost: $0.10 (charged once per processor type per execution)
   ├── Track cost: $2.50 (document processing - 5 pages @ $0.50/page)
   └── Run cost: $2.50

6. Run 5: Manual Re-execution - Clear Processor
   ├── Base cost: $0.00 (already charged in Run 1)
   ├── Track cost: $0.00 (cached result)
   └── Run cost: $0.00

7. Execution Summary
   ├── Total processor runs: 5
   ├── Total tracked cost: $3.75
   ├── Total base cost: $0.40 (4 unique processor types × $0.10 each)
   ├── Total execution cost: $4.15
   └── Execution status: Success
```

## Cost Examples

### Typical Processing Costs
- **Simple Underwriting**: $1.50 - $3.00
- **Complex Underwriting**: $5.00 - $15.00
- **Document-Heavy**: $10.00 - $25.00

### Cost Savings Through Caching
- **First Run**: $3.00 (full API costs)
- **Subsequent Runs**: $0.30 (base costs only)
- **Savings**: 90% cost reduction

## Key Metrics
- **Total Cost per Execution**: Base costs + tracked costs
- **Cost per Service**: Breakdown by external service
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Cost optimization effectiveness
- **Cost per Processor Type**: Spending by category

## Business Value
- **Accurate Billing**: Granular cost tracking for every operation
- **Cost Optimization**: 90% savings through intelligent caching
- **Financial Control**: Budget management and cost forecasting
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all cost-generating activities

## Cost Optimization Features
- **Caching Strategy**: Significant savings through cache hits
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Controlled retry costs with failure isolation
