# Processor Cost Tracking System - Executive Summary

## Overview

The AURA processing engine implements a comprehensive cost tracking system that provides detailed visibility into processing costs, enabling accurate billing, cost optimization, and financial reporting. The system tracks costs at multiple levels: execution, processor runs, and individual operations.

## Key Cost Components

### 1. Processor Base Costs
- **Charged once per execution per processor type**
- Configurable via database or configuration files
- Examples: $0.10 per processor type per execution
- **Cost Model**: If Clear Processor runs 3 times in one execution, base cost is charged only once ($0.10)

### 2. External API Costs
- **Charged per API call**
- Varies by service provider (CLEAR: $0.75, Experian: $0.50, etc.)
- Tracked per individual API request
- **Cost Optimization**: Cached results incur $0.00 cost

### 3. Processing Costs
- **Variable costs based on business rules**
- Examples: OCR processing ($0.50 per page), data transformation
- Determined by processor implementation
- **Cost Model**: Bank statement with 5 pages = $2.50 processing cost
