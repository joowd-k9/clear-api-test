### Key Design Patterns

1. **Processor Pattern**: Standardized interface for all processors
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different execution strategies (parallel/sequential)
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance for external API calls
4. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
5. **Event-Driven**: Publishing events for cross-module communication
