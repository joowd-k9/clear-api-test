AURA PROCESSING ENGINE - EXECUTION PIPELINE SUMMARY
====================================================

WHAT IT IS:
A smart execution framework that processes underwriting data through a standardized 3-step pipeline (validate → process → extract) with configurable execution strategies and intelligent retry mechanisms.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Takes a list of inputs (documents, data, etc.)
2. Runs each through the same 3-step pipeline
3. Uses one of three execution strategies (sequential, threaded, or process-based)
4. Handles failures intelligently by resuming from the exact failure point
5. Tracks costs for every operation and optimizes through caching

KEY INNOVATIONS:

SMART ERROR RETRY SYSTEM:
- If validation fails → retry from validation
- If processing fails → skip validation, retry from processing
- If extraction fails → skip validation & processing, retry from extraction
- No wasted work on retries

EXECUTION STRATEGIES:
- Sequential: One at a time (good for debugging)
- Threaded: Concurrent I/O operations (good for API calls)
- Process: True parallel processing (good for heavy calculations)

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Receives documents from Data Collection team
- Sends extracted factors to AI Decision team
- Publishes events to Workflow Orchestration team
- Stores results in Data Infrastructure systems

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- 95%+ success rate
- 90% cost reduction through caching
- 80% reduction in manual processing time
- Complete audit trail for all operations

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Automates manual underwriting data processing
- Provides accurate cost tracking for billing
- Enables intelligent retry without wasted work
- Scales from simple to complex processing scenarios

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:
- 13 different processor types implemented
- External API integrations with rate limiting
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Real-time monitoring and cost optimization
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

This system transforms raw underwriting data into standardized, validated factors that feed into AI decision-making, while providing complete cost visibility and operational efficiency.
